# Digital Vigilance
Prevents from sleeping when the machine is idle. Similar app to mouse jiggler. It moves the mouse unnoticeably (back and forth by one pixel).
<br>The app is lightweight and efficient. It consumes almost no CPU.

To use it without terminal (just tray icon in menu bar) you need to build Mac bundle with the script:<br>
`$ ./bundle_mac.sh`<br>
